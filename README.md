# Project Highlights

     Marylyn created the first submission with the Resnet34 model that worked. Isabel also worked on the Resnet101 model which also worked. Gowri worked on the Resnet18 model 
    
Clearly summarizes the key aspects of the project, techniques used, and major findings.

# Setup & Execution

    First, our team created the 

# Project Overview
    The project is to create an image classification model that can help classify skin conditions for patients who are underrepresented 
    and underresearched in the field of dermatology. The model takes images of samples of patients with a variety of skin conditions and 
    needs to be capable of classifying what the skin condition is. 

# Data Exploration

    Demonstrates strong data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization techniques with appropriate visuals.
    
    We explored the data by initially analyzing which columns there were, which data sets and values, how many data points, and the pictures of the conditions that 

# Model Development

    As applicable, clearly describes model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and training approach, with justification for choices. 
    We investigated five of the largest and most popular image classification algorithms and models, and we decided to use the ResNet models for image classificaiton. Each group member looked at one variant of the ResNet models and created a corresponding model that calculated predictions for the given data set.
